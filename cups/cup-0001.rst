Short Description
-----------------

The CUP discusses the design of adding photolysis mechanism to Cantera.

Long Description
----------------

Cantera does not natively support photochemical reactions. Adding photolsis to Cantera
requires some deep understanding of the Cantera code base. The starting point is the
``Kinetics`` class. The ``Kinetics`` class is the manager that solves a kinetic reaction
systems. A kinetic reaction is a chemical reaction that takes the form of:

.. math::

    A + B + \ldots <=> C + \ldots

or

.. math::

    A => B + C + \ldots

Cantera supports two kinds of kinetic reactions, reversible and irreversible. The
reversible reaction is indicated by the ``<=>`` sign and the irreversible reaction is
indicated by the ``=>`` sign.
